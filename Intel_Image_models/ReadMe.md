## Running the Model on Kaggle
I have provided the models in a Kaggle notebook that can be directly imported and executed. The environment, model, and evaluation code are already set up. To run the notebook smoothly:
- Update the **model name** in the specified section of the notebook.
- Check the training progress periodically. Save the last checkpoint and metrics sheet after approximately 12 hours of training.

Additionally, I have updated the architecture in a previously run Kaggle notebook for simplicity. The updated notebook highlights the exact locations where modifications (such as model name and architecture changes) need to be made to ensure smooth execution. Detailed comments are included in the notebook to guide these updates.

## Results
The models achieved accuracies ranging from **69% to 92%** across datasets and configurations. Detailed results will include:
- Tables for top-1 and top-5 accuracy.
- Graphs for training and validation metrics across epochs.
